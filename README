A smaller app used as practice and to get some of the features of the above app
right.

The app has 2 main components:
- A GUI which displays stats and predictions about your current team (summoners
and champions must be manually entered). Includes averages, sums (like your
team's total kda, total %win)
- Components which get ranked stats for champs (per summoner)
