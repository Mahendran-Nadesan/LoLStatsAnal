Notes:

Class differences/redundancies:

This applies mainly to the new, smaller app: LoLTeamCheck

Each class is meant to only work on its own data - i.e. I want to avoid 
importing classes into other classes. 

Current issue: Redundant references
Classes: staticdata.py & rankeddata.py

In order to get ranked data for a champ for a summoner, I could use, in my GUI:

(1)
idnum = GrabStaticSata.get_champid("Jarvan IV")
stats = GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_id(idnum)

OR, 
(2)
in GrabRankedData, I could sort the data from:
stats = api_instance.get_ranked_stats_by_summoner_id(id)
http://www.xvideos.com/video3270092/crackhead_sucks_dick_in_sex_documentary_on_the_lives_of_street_hookers

which comes as:
a list in stats['champions'], with stats['champions'][0]['stats'] &
stats['champions'][0]['id']

into:
new_stats['Jarvan IV'] with ['stats'] and ['id'] which means calling:
GrabStaticData.get_champid(name) for each champ

then use GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_name("Jarvan IV")
