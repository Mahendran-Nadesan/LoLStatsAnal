Notes:
===============================================================================
Class differences/redundancies:
----------------------------------
This applies mainly to the new, smaller app: LoLTeamCheck

Each class is meant to only work on its own data - i.e. I want to avoid 
importing classes into other classes. 

Current issue: Redundant references
Classes: staticdata.py & rankeddata.py

In order to get ranked data for a champ for a summoner, I could use, in my GUI:

(1)
idnum = GrabStaticSata.get_champid("Jarvan IV")
stats = GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_id(idnum)

OR, 
(2)
in GrabRankedData, I could sort the data from:
stats = api_instance.get_ranked_stats_by_summoner_id(id)


which comes as:
a list in stats['champions'], with stats['champions'][0]['stats'] &
stats['champions'][0]['id']

into:
new_stats['Jarvan IV'] with ['stats'] and ['id'] which means calling:
GrabStaticData.get_champid(name) for each champ

then use GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_name("Jarvan IV")

===============================================================================
Major Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make the model. Currently all important info is being played with inside the
controller. DONE

2. Find a better way to do the imports (redundant imports), and *maybe* 
refactor so that the controller calls the GUI in main.py, not the other way 
around.	DONE

3. Find a better way to convert Riot's JSON names to my headers.

4. Sort out the StringVar()/IntVar() issue. Currently all variables are 
StringVar(), but that will be problematic for adding, etc.

5. Currently pressing tab cycles you through each row in a column, instead of 
vice-versa. Should be [S.Name]->[C.Name]->"Go!". Refactor code for this.

6. In the controller, do I really want to be passing arguments continuously to
the model's methods? The only alternatives I can currently think of would be
to:

(1) call each successive method in the current method:

def _get_ranked_data(self, summoner_name, champ_name):

	self.id = get-summoner-id
	data = GrabRankedData(...self.id)
	self._get_champ_stats(champ_name)

def _get_champ_stats(self, summoner_name, champ_name):
	etc.

(2)	save persistent attributes, and call them in each method (i.e. arguments 
already inside the method)

controller.py:
def _process_line(self, i):
        [summoner_name, champ_name] = self.get_user_values(i)
		self.model.take_these_vars(summoner_name, champ_name)
        self.model._get_summoner_data()
        self.model._get_ranked_data()
        self.model._get_champ_stats()
    
model.py
def 

7. Deal with weird character encodings.

8. Find out how people do floats as (Tk.var()). Either:

(1) Write a method to convert to float, do the maths, convert back to 
StringVar()

(2) Check for native methods for floats (because IntVar rounds).

SORT OF DONE - DoubleVar() doesn't work for strings.

9. Write appropriate try...except methods for invalid summoner names and 
champion names. Requires changes to riotapi_py (get error codes: 404, 503, 
etc.), LoLTeamCheckerGUI (appropriate message boxes), and 
LoLTeamCheckerController (maybe a _catch_error() called in _process_line()?).
===============================================================================
Small QOL Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make sure champion names can be entered into the GUI in a case insensitive
form - i.e.:
(1) convert the static data list stored locally into a list with one case,

and, 
(2) make sure the entry from the GUI gets converted before being checked.

2. Write checks for region (currently LoLTeamCheckerController has "euw" 
hardcoded for its self.api_instance...)

3. Make right, middle, label frames uniform in size (currently don't correspond
to label head sizes).

4. Make fonts smaller, pad for size, etc.

5. Automate frame indexing (i.e. don't call self.frames[explicit number]).

6. Sort out option menu for regions - lock size, make a better drop-down?

Misc.:

1. Create all frames [x]
