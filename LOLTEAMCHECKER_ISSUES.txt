Class differences/redundancies:
----------------------------------
This applies mainly to the new, smaller app: LoLTeamCheck

Each class is meant to only work on its own data - i.e. I want to avoid 
importing classes into other classes. 

Current issue: Redundant references
Classes: staticdata.py & rankeddata.py

In order to get ranked data for a champ for a summoner, I could use, in my GUI:

(1)
idnum = GrabStaticSata.get_champid("Jarvan IV")
stats = GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_id(idnum)

OR, 
(2)
in GrabRankedData, I could sort the data from:
stats = api_instance.get_ranked_stats_by_summoner_id(id)


which comes as:
a list in stats['champions'], with stats['champions'][0]['stats'] &
stats['champions'][0]['id']

into:
new_stats['Jarvan IV'] with ['stats'] and ['id'] which means calling:
GrabStaticData.get_champid(name) for each champ

then use GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_name("Jarvan IV")

===============================================================================
Major Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make the model. Currently all important info is being played with inside the
controller. DONE

2. Find a better way to do the imports (redundant imports), and *maybe* 
refactor so that the controller calls the GUI in main.py, not the other way 
around.	DONE

3. Find a better way to convert Riot's JSON names to my headers.

4. Sort out the StringVar()/IntVar() issue. Currently all variables are 
StringVar(), but that will be problematic for adding, etc. DONE (see 8.?)

5. Currently pressing tab cycles you through each row in a column, instead of 
vice-versa. Should be [S.Name]->[C.Name]->"Go!". Refactor code for this.

6. In the controller, do I really want to be passing arguments continuously to
the model's methods? The only alternatives I can currently think of would be
to:

(1) call each successive method in the current method:

def _get_ranked_data(self, summoner_name, champ_name):

	self.id = get-summoner-id
	data = GrabRankedData(...self.id)
	self._get_champ_stats(champ_name)

def _get_champ_stats(self, summoner_name, champ_name):
	etc.

(2)	save persistent attributes, and call them in each method (i.e. arguments 
already inside the method)

controller.py:
def _process_line(self, i):
        [summoner_name, champ_name] = self.get_user_values(i)
		self.model.take_these_vars(summoner_name, champ_name)
        self.model._get_summoner_data()
        self.model._get_ranked_data()
        self.model._get_champ_stats()
    
model.py
def 

7. Deal with weird character encodings. DONE (need to test)

8. Find out how people do floats as (Tk.var()). Either:

(1) Write a method to convert to float, do the maths, convert back to 
StringVar()

(2) Check for native methods for floats (because IntVar rounds).

SORT OF DONE - DoubleVar() doesn't work for strings - i.e. "Prediction".

9. Write appropriate try...except methods for invalid summoner names and 
champion names. Requires changes to riotapi_py (get error codes: 404, 503, 
etc.), LoLTeamCheckerGUI (appropriate message boxes), and 
LoLTeamCheckerController (maybe a _catch_error() called in _process_line()?).

More importantly, make sure things are handled in the appropriate places.
(1) riotapi must return a riotapiexception. DONE
(2) the MODEL must check for thrown/raised exceptions. DONE

10. Reduce redundant api calls - i.e. if "Go" is pressed, and the summoner
exists, then ranked stats will be saved in the Model. No need to recall the
api when a legitimate champion (one that the summoner has played) has stats.
DONE

11. If a champ's stats are successfully called, the next unsuccessful champion
call will not produce an error. Fix:
(1) Make sure error message pops up.
(2)	Reset all fields to "0".
DONE

12. IMPORTANT:
Model needs to be restructured in terms of its try...except loops - i.e. they
should stop after an exception.
DONE

13. Need a test suite for all possible conditions.

14. Rework the model in terms of .data and .final_stats to accommodate:
1. _get_summary_stats() fails if called multiple times because .final_stats
will have dicts that have 'Total Games' and dicts that don't.
2. Uniform naming across basic JSON stats and final stats, like 
"totalSessionsPlayed" vs "Total Games" - EWAve is the issue
3. If a player that was initially checked does not comprise the 5 now checked,
make sure he isn't added to the totals, this actually applies to all players 
looked up during the session. i.e. find a way to capture current state. DONE

15. "get all stats" and "get summary stats" don't always work! FIXED

16. Add a boolean flag so that certain errors are only thrown (hence error
boxes only pop up) when _process_line is accessed on its own, not via 
_process_all.

17. Fix dicts, handling of _set_summary_values() or whatever it's called. 
DONE?

18. Write some tests/just test that EWA[KDA] is being worked out properly.
===============================================================================
Small QOL Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make sure champion names can be entered into the GUI in a case insensitive
form - i.e.:
(1) convert the static data list stored locally into a list with one case,

and, 
(2) make sure the entry from the GUI gets converted before being checked.

2. Write checks for region (currently LoLTeamCheckerController has "euw" 
hardcoded for its self.api_instance...) DONE

3. Make right, middle, label frames uniform in size (currently don't correspond
to label head sizes).

4. Make fonts smaller, pad for size, etc.

5. Automate frame indexing (i.e. don't call self.frames[explicit number]).

6. Sort out option menu for regions - lock size, make a better drop-down? DONE

7. Use a version of print "{y:2f}".format(y=0.13452) instead of explicit 
rounding?

8. Edit all rehashing dictionary lookups, change from:
for k in d:
    print k, d[k]
	
to:
for k, v in d.items():
    print k, v

9. Sort out sub-framing of summary frame.	
	
Misc.:

1. Create all frames [x]
